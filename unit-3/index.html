		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p><img src="about me.jpg"></p>
		<p>I am a digital enthusiast but this coding stuffs are very difficult. <strong>It is getting better now.</strong>
		This the third week of learning coding. I'm definitely outside my comfort zone which is fab but it is gardening that reigns high in my heart. A quick look early this morning, it was a pleasant surprise that the lavenders are flowering now. I can't say that my pansies and primulas are well as the young plants are still fighting to grow amidst a formidable army of slugs, sluicing their poisonous slimes. I think, I will inform my son-in-law if he can create a slug slime anti- aging, or super elixir cream face or something. The patio fruit trees are sprouting quite gallantly despite their minutae size. It doesn't help that when the rest of family members said it would be cheaper the buy the fruit in the market. Effortless too with no daily struggle of hunting for the slugs and intense focus looking behind all the leaves searching for an early sign of sickness or heartache over tomato blights. Hey people, give some support! 
		<p> Nonetheless, they missed the point:<br>


				<i><strong>As I look out to my garden<br></i></strong>
				<i><strong> I feel a sense of pride<br></i></strong>
				<i><strong>It really is a lovely room<br></i></strong>
				<i><strong> Except is it outside.<br></i></strong>
		</p>

		<p> Here is a poem about slugs:<br>

				<i><strong> I ooze <br></i></strong>
      <i><strong>from kitchen<br></i></strong>
                  <i><strong>to desk <br></i></strong>
                       <i><strong>to couch<br></i></strong>
                             <i><strong>leaving<br></i></strong>
                                    <i><strong>a trail of words<br></i></strong>
                                                  <i><strong>behind</i></strong>

		<h2>My work</h2>
		<p><img src="my work.jpg"></p>
			<p> Back in 2011, I had no clue at all how to use PowerPoint. I thought if I sat quietly in a dark corner, no one could see that IT and I had an amicable divorce forever. Then I changed my job because I got bored with policy development. I thought facing this beast called 'digital' was something I must do. It took me several months teaching myself how to use PowerPoint as a starting point.
